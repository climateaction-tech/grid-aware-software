# What can you do to help?

Big Tech is listening to us, and that this is an inflection point right now.

We have the opportunity and responsibility to shape corporate discourse and action around this in a responsible direction that will reduce emissions in a noticeable way. 

You can do this by:
- Sharing this repo with practitioners of carbon-aware approaches to educate and inform;
- Contribute to this repo through raising issues or suggesting edits;
- Communicating the ideas and issues presented in this post to your work community and beyond;
- Conducting further research and case-studies into the dangers of current carbon-aware approaches and sharing those; and
- Building upon the initial concepts of grid-aware software through research, prototypes, case studies, or feedback;

**The choice is yours. The time is now.**
