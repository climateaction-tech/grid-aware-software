## TL;DR / Executive Summary

1. The core concept of shifting compute jobs to respond to the grid is a smart one. But there are only small-to-zero carbon reduction benefits from implementing most current carbon-aware time-shifting and location-shifting computing approaches. 

1. If such approaches are adopted at scale without implementation constraints, they are likely to increase emissions and destabilise electricity grid systems. This does not improve the tech industry’s contributions to global sustainability, but rather worsens them. It also risks becoming, or is already, a greenwashing effort.

1. The key failure is never applying appropriate warning labels to draw attention to key caveats. Such as
- Carbon-aware computing that can yield _actual_ carbon reductions runs when demand is low using curtailed electricity in stable grids, or on genuinely additive renewable electricity.

- “_Is your compute’s net electricity demand reducing?_” is the central question if we really want to make computing more sustainable. Acknowledging Jevons paradox and accepting that optimisation alone isn't enough, means we must find ways to limit the growth of computing's resource use.

4. We need to usher in a more mature, holistic and nuanced approach to reducing the CO2 emissions from running software. For now we’re calling this _‘grid-aware computing’_.

## The story about this work 

The body of work presented here, started after Ismael Velasco posted questions and research into <a href="https://climateaction.tech/community/">CAT's Slack</a> checking some research he was doing about carbon aware software and asking for input. Hannah Smith, amongst many others contributed to the discussion. 

Following some debate on the issue within CAT's Slack, Hannah proposed the idea of working with Ismael to turn his initial findings/musings into a blog post for the wider CAT and developer community. The aim was to take the existing research and make it accessible to those with less experience in the topic. 

As Hannah began to do this she thought that the article could go one step further in order to land constructively with the intended audience. She thought it needed to propose some clear, viable alternatives to the problems being highlighted. Afterall, those working on the topic of carbon aware software are doing so with the best of intentions and are all trying to do the same thing - find ways to get the tech sector to reduce it's carbon emissions. 

She therefore played around and came up with the concept of '_grid-aware computing_' (she's still not sure that title id the best one, but nevermind!). With the help of all the people credited in this article, including Ismael, she fleshed out and structured these ideas into the writing you see here.


If it were not for <a href="https://cliamteaction.tech">CAT</a> this work would not have come to fruition on this way - thank you CAT for bringing people together and providing a safe space for people to explore their ideas!
